### Hi there, my name is Munara 👋

### I am a daughter, sister, traveller and 🕵️‍♀️ IT researcher 

- 🌱 Currently practicing Java, as I find structural solution and implemention joyful than the frontend I used to do
- :computer: Have worked on HTML5/CSS3/SASS/JS(JQuery) projects via Bootstrap/NPM
- 🔭 2023 Goals: Settle in IT projects as an IT researcher (engineer/developer who cares?!)
- 👊 Why: In order to be able to build my own projects (thus an empire which brings to people a good use)
- 👩‍🎤 Fun facts: I love to draw and sing.
- :earth_asia: Have travelled 32 countries around the globe
